## Description

This Progressive Web App (PWA) Text Editor was created using starter code from my UT Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp. I completed the application to run entirely in the browser, even with low internet connectivity. The Text Editor can also be installed as a desktop application and run completely offline. Either way, the application allows users to save text and code snippets regardless of their internet connection. Ivory Text Editor utilizes Express, Node.js, the idb package for IndexedDB API usage, caching with Workbox, and Webpack with a service worker.
